    <h1>Introduction to Javascript.</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that can be included on web pages to make them more interactive. You can use it to check or modify the contents of forms, change images, open new windows and write dynamic page content. You can even use it with CSS to make DHTML (Dynamic HyperText Markup Language).</p>
    <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java language was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language, with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</p>
<ul>
  <li>At present, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device where there exists a special program called the JavaScript engine.</li>
  <li>The browser has an embedded engine, sometimes it’s also called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Basic Requirement to Learn JS.</h1>
<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
  <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
  <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Javascript And Java</h1>
<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">
  function greetMe(yourName) { <br>
  alert("Hello " + yourName);<br>
} <br>
greetMe("World");<br>
</code>
<p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
<h1>Declaring variables</h1>
<p>you can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
<p>With the keyword For example,</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">
  var x =42;
</code>
<p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br><br>

By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>

<code style="background-color: white;">x =42;</code>
<p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br><br>

With the keyword let. For example,</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">let y =42;</code>
<p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

<h1>Variable Scope</h1>
<p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
<p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

<code style="background-color: white;">if (true) {<br>
  var x = 5;<br>
}<br>
console.log(x);  // 5</code>
<p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">if (true) {<br>
  let y = 5;<br>
}<br>
console.log(y);<br>  
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
<h1>Global Variables</h1>
<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
<h1>Constants</h1>
<p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">cost PI=3.14;</code>
<p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>

<p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR<br>
function f() {};<br>
const f = 5;<br>
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO<br>
function f() {<br>
  const g = 5;<br>
  var g;<br>
  //statements<br>
}</code>
<h1>Datatypes</h1>
<p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

<h1>If-Else Statement</h1>
<p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">if (condition) {<br>
  statement_1;<br>
} else {<br>
  statement_2;<br>
}</code>
<p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
<h1>While Statement</h1>
<p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">while (condition)<br>
  statement</code>
  <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
<code style="background-color: white;">
  var n = 0;<br>
var x = 0;<br>
while (n < 3) {<br>
  n++;<br>
  x += n;<br>
}
</code>


<h1>Function Declaration</h1>
<p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the function.
</li>
  <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
</li>
  <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
</ul>

<code style="background-color: white;">function square(number) {<br>
  return number * number;<br>
}<br></code>
